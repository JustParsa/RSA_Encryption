RSA_Encryption
==============

I decided to implement the famous RSA encryption in python. I had fun doing it. Obviously I had to do steal some methods to allow python to quickly generate huge primes. I stole the code for the Rabin Miller and the generation of huge primes but aside from that, the rest is done by me.
