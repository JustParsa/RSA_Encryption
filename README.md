RSA_Encryption
==============

I decided to implement the famous RSA encryption in python. I had fun doing it. Obviously I had to steal some methods to allow python to quickly generate huge primes. I stole the code for the Rabin Miller and the generation of huge primes but aside from that, the rest is done by me.

All modules are fully functional and tested for python 3.4.1. All that's left for me to do is integrate it and sequence them properly (namely the convert_to.py module into main.py) but that's pretty trivial so I'll just do it when I have more time.
